This app implements full CRUD capability for worlds as well as allowing users to delete regions, events and maps separately so long as they were the creator of the world.

<h2><b>Reflection</b></h2>

This project was my fullstack capstone project for nashville software school. I was excited to build this project because I have always had a passion for world building and designing fictional settings. I saw this project as the perfect opportunity to test out new skills such as implementing a drawing feature with saving, as well as further improving my front end skills.
